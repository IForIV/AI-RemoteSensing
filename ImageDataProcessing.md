# Image Data Processing

[Work in Progress]

Welcome to the Image Data Processing section of AI-RemoteSensing. This section is dedicated to showcasing the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in processing and analyzing image data in the field of Remote Sensing. Here, you'll find notebooks that demonstrate how to manipulate, interpret, and extract valuable information from digital images.

## Beginner

This section is designed for those new to image data processing. The notebooks here provide a gentle introduction to basic concepts and techniques. You'll learn how to handle image data, apply simple transformations, and prepare data for further analysis.

## Intermediate

The Intermediate section delves deeper into the world of image data processing. The notebooks in this section cover more complex topics, including various image analysis techniques, feature extraction, and the application of AI in image classification and segmentation.

## Advanced

The Advanced section is for those who are comfortable with image data processing basics and want to explore cutting-edge techniques and applications. Here you'll find notebooks that tackle complex, real-world image data processing problems using advanced AI techniques.

Currently, you can explore the following notebooks:

- [SAM-BBox](https://github.com/LucasOsco/AI-RemoteSensing/blob/main/image_notebook/sam_bbox_v01.ipynb): This notebook delves into the Segment Anything Model (SAM), demonstrating its application for bounding box-based remote sensing image analysis.

- [SAM-Point](https://github.com/LucasOsco/AI-RemoteSensing/blob/main/image_notebook/sam_point_v01.ipynb): In this notebook, you'll learn about point-based analysis in remote sensing images using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) method.

- [SAM-Text](https://github.com/LucasOsco/AI-RemoteSensing/blob/main/image_notebook/sam_text_v01.ipynb): For this notebook, a text-prompt-based analysis is implemented using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) on georeferenced images.

More notebooks will be added to this section over time, so stay tuned for more advanced topics and applications in image data processing!
